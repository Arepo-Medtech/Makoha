## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M6 — case-set terminology batch-verify + CI-blocking eval gate (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Receipts + gate complete; difficulty top-up surfaced as INPUT-GATED. Branch `step-6-case-eval-gate`. npm test 20/20, `npm run verification` pass, trunk stubs 9/9, `eval:cases` PASS, `cases:verify-codes` idempotent (re-run: 109 already done).

### Change
- `scripts/verify-case-codes.mjs` + `npm run cases:verify-codes` (new): batch-verifies every codes_manifest entry against the terminology MCP server (terminology_lookup, query.kind="code"; one server spawn for the whole run). **All 109 candidate codes across the 51 manifest-bearing cases receipted**; per-code receipt (request_id/timestamp_utc/upstream/mode/validated_code/system_version) written into the entry; status flipped `unverified_pending_terminology_receipt` → **`mock_verified_pending_live_ncts`** — deliberately honest: the mock server echoes codes (binding, not clinical validation); live NCTS batch-REvalidation happens at M11 (FMEA F5), and receipt `mode:"mock"` means the M1 mode-normaliser blocks these as proof in any live-enforced context. Fail-safe: a lookup that does not echo the exact code leaves the entry unverified and exits non-zero.
- `scripts/eval-case-gate.mjs` + `npm run eval:cases` (new) + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` step **"Case-set evaluation gate (blocking)"**: the deterministic release gate over the eval set. BLOCKS on: <45 attested conforming cases; any manifest-listed file whose on-disk sha256 differs (integrity transitively re-asserts ingest-time schema validity + the firewall leak verdict **without ever parsing a sealed node** — sealed files are only streamed through sha256, exactly as ingest does); a 00/01/02 file failing its schema; any code left unreceipted; unattested cases counting toward the minimum. WARNS (non-blocking until top-up): distribution vs 60/30/10 and the 3-tier/3-category/5-specialty coverage minimum. **Current: PASS — 51 attested ≥ 45; distribution 45/6/0 (88/12/0); coverage 2 tiers · 2 diagnosis categories · 17 specialties.**
- Named exception, register-tracked: `SPEC-CARD-04-00001` (hand-built reference case, pre-ingest) has no case_manifest — skipped by name in verify-codes, excluded from the attested count in the gate; **NEW register item `reference-case-manifest-missing`** (Low) with a retrofit build_action.

### Difficulty top-up — surfaced as INPUT-GATED (not silently skipped)
The M6 authoring component ("author atypical/complex cases toward 60/30/10") cannot be completed by this agent alone: the eval gate counts **only clinician-attested** cases, so machine-generated `llm_generated_unreviewed` bundles cannot move the attested distribution by design. Reaching 60/30/10 while keeping the 45 straightforward cases needs ≈17 atypical (tiers 02/03/04) + ≈8 complex (05/06/07) **attested** cases — i.e. clinical source material (SOAP notes) for the kit pipeline and/or clinician attestation, which only the operator can supply. Register updated accordingly; the gate's distribution warning flips to blocking once the mix reaches design.

### Register impact
- `case-set-underpopulated` / **R-23**: receipts + CI gate → done; distribution top-up → input-gated (evidence updated with the true envelope-derived distribution).
- **NEW** `reference-case-manifest-missing` (Low, pf:false).
- Firewall unchanged: the new scripts parse only case_manifest + 00/01/02; sealed nodes are hashed (streamed), never parsed — same boundary as `cases:ingest`.

### Verification
`npm test` 20/20; `npm run verification` pass; `npm run trunk:stub:all` 9/9; `npm run eval:cases` PASS (warnings as designed); `cases:verify-codes --dry-run` re-run shows 109 already done (idempotent); changed tracked files = exactly the 51 case manifests + package.json + ci.yml + registers.

## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M5 — Clinician Verification Portal release gate (HITL checkpoint contract built) (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Complete (gate + contract; portal UI/workflow out of engineering scope). Branch `step-5-portal-gate`. npm test 20/20 (new suite added; 3 consecutive full-suite greens), `npm run verification` pass, trunk stubs 9/9, `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift.

### Change
- `mcp/schemas/verification-portal-decision.schema.json` (new — the one plan-sanctioned schema addition, C9/§3.5.5): **VerificationGateRecord** `{ run_id, candidate_output_hash, clinician_id, decision: approved|rejected|amended, decided_at_utc, signature_ref, amended_output_hash?(required when amended), notes? }`, additionalProperties:false. An amendment is a NEW medicolegal artifact with its own hash; the original candidate_output_hash remains the record of what was generated.
- `portal/verification-gate.js` (new): zod mirror (lockstep-tested against the JSON schema via ajv-2020) + the mechanical checkpoint. `recordGateDecision()` validates and APPENDS (records never mutate; latest decision is effective — re-review supported). `releaseToPatient({candidate_output_hash, output})` is **fail-closed**: refuses in mock/dry_run (mode-normaliser guard — dev contexts have no patients), refuses without a gate record, refuses `rejected`, and releases ONLY text that **re-hashes** to the attested hash (approved→candidate; amended→amended_output_hash) — the gate computes the hash itself, never trusts one it is handed. Refusals return named reasons (a patient path escalates to a clinician, never retries around the gate).
- `portal/README.md` (new): scope (gate only, no UI), the adoption rule — **every future patient-facing path MUST call releaseToPatient()**; a path that does not is a Critical defect (F13) — and what remains before "portal built".
- `test/contract-verification-gate.js` (new, wired into `npm test` → CI): zod↔JSON-schema lockstep (accept + reject fixtures), patient path closed without a record, exact-hash binding (altered text refused), rejected never releases, amended releases only the amended text, latest-decision-wins, mock/dry_run never release, malformed requests fail closed, contract violations throw at record time.
- `package.json`: suite appended to the `test` chain (CI gate). `.claude/schema-index.md` updated (new schema row) in the same step per <context_loading>.
- messaging-geo remains **UNWIRED** (M13, post-Portal-complete) per the M5 directive.

### Invariants
Human-in-the-loop is now mechanically enforceable at the release boundary (was policy-only). Hash discipline strengthened: release binds to recomputed SHA-256 of the exact bytes. Nothing patient-facing opened — the gate existing closes paths, it does not open them; the other release blockers stand.

### Register impact
- `clinician-verification-portal-unbuilt` (Critical, pf:true) → **PARTIAL** (gate contract built; clinician UI/workflow, authenticated identity/signature capture, and WORM gate-record storage (M8) remain); gap-register §1b portal row updated; index re-synced; schema-index gained the 13th pipeline contract. FMEA F13 residual 4×5 → 1×5 per plan.
- Flake note (honest record): one unreproducible mid-chain `npm test` abort was observed once during the M5 gate run (suite stopped after 6 with no error captured by the grep filter); four consecutive full-suite runs pass 20/20 — if it recurs, investigate contract-pipeline spawn timing first.

### Verification
`npm test` (20 suites) green ×3 consecutive; `npm run verification` pass; `npm run trunk:stub:all` 9/9; `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift.

---

## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M4 — session-bound persistence enforced (release blocker cleared at the enforcement layer) (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `step-4-session-store`. npm test 19/19 (new suite added), `npm run verification` pass, trunk stubs 9/9, `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift.

### Change
- `verification/session-store.js` (new): technical enforcement of "no persistence beyond session" (<data_handling>) and Trust Boundary 4. **Memory-only** — no disk path, no serialisation API (contract test asserts no persistence-shaped export and an untouched data dir). **Encounter-scoped lifetime** — `openEncounter` → working state → `closeEncounter` destroys everything; closed refs never reopen (no zombie sessions); reads/writes after close throw; writing to a never-opened encounter throws (no implicit/untracked state). **Mechanical demographic guard** — demographic-looking keys anywhere in a nested value (name/dob/address/medicare/ihi/phone/email/…) and IHI-shaped values (16 digits, 800360-prefixed) are REFUSED with a thrown error; conservative over-blocking by design. Medicolegal ledger explicitly documented as exempt (append-only, PHI-free by `.strict()` — it must survive the encounter).
- **Adoption contract** (documented in-module + register): any future stateful session path (portal flows, patient conversations, cross-trunk working memory) MUST hold its working state in this store; holding it anywhere else reintroduces the gap. No production session flow exists today (trunk runs are stateless) — the store is the gate artifact.
- `test/contract-session-store.js` (new, wired into `npm test` → CI): round-trip while open; close destroys (count-verified); no resurrection; no implicit creation; encounter isolation; demographic guard refusals (top-level, nested, array-buried, IHI-in-string) + legitimate clinical state passes; no persistence surface; filesystem untouched; destroy-all sweep.
- `package.json`: suite appended to the `test` chain (CI gate).

### Release blockers (restated per the M4 directive)
1. **Pharmacology vendor live + validated** — open (M9, input-gated on contract/credentials).
2. **Clinician Verification Portal** — open (M5, next engineering step).
3. **Deterministic investigation parser** — built mock/dev; range sign-off + live source open (M10, input-gated).
4. **Session-bound persistence** — **enforcement CLEARED this step** (adoption re-checked per future session flow; real-patient content persistence additionally consent-gated).
No patient path opens until all four are green; nothing in this step is patient-facing.

### Register impact
- `session-persistence-unenforced` (Critical, pf:true) → **COMPLETE / resolved (enforcement)**; gap-register **R-10 → "Enforcement built 2026-07-03 (M4)"**; index re-synced. FMEA F12 residual 3×5 → 1×5 per plan.
- `content-store-production-gated` unchanged (real-patient content persistence still consent-gated by design).

### Verification
`npm test` (19 suites) green; `npm run verification` pass; `npm run trunk:stub:all` 9/9; `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift.

---

## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M3 — live context-injection allow-list (scoring-store firewall at the packet boundary) (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `step-3-context-allowlist`. npm test 18/18 (new suite added), `npm run verification` pass, trunk stubs 9/9, `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift, scoring-store firewall re-checked — NOT breached.

### Change
- `verification/context-allowlist.js` (new): DEFAULT-DENY mirror of the `cases:ingest` field-scoped firewall at the packet boundary (§3.5.5 `contextAllowList(caseFields) → { injectable_fields, rejected_fields }`). `01` allows only `demographics` / `opening_complaint` / `history_as_reported` (channel **packet**, category-mapped to the Fact enum); `02` allows only `disclosure_items[].{clinical_fact,patient_response_template,patient_deflection_template}`, `patient_initiated_exchanges[].patient_text`, `deflection_behaviours[].deflection_text_template` — classified channel **exchange** (simulator dialogue material) and **never converted to packet facts**. All of `00`, `psychosocial_profile`, `digital_tablet_field_map`, unknown nodes/fields, and `02` scoring/gate sub-fields reject. **A sealed scoring node (`10_`–`13_`) anywhere in the input THROWS** ("SCORING-STORE FIREWALL") and halts packet assembly — a breach attempt never degrades to a dropped field.
- `verification/pipeline.js`: `contextInjection()` enforces the allow-list on the new `case_content` path; `runPipeline({ case_content })` threads it. No case content supplied → behaviour unchanged (regression-tested).
- **Quarantine (surfaced, not silently resolved):** `objective_data_offered` is ingest-allow-listed, but CLAUDE.md `<data_handling>` requires the patient-reported-vitals sanitiser policy be confirmed **before** this path ships it. The field rejects with a reason naming the policy; tracked as new register item `objective-data-offered-sanitiser-policy` (Medium, pf:true, input-gated on operator/clinical confirmation). Flip is one line + a test once confirmed.
- `test/contract-context-allowlist.js` (new, wired into `npm test` → CI): default-deny sweep (no SIM-ONLY/SCORER-ONLY marker injectable), all four sealed nodes throw (dummy keys, synthetic fixtures — **no case file read**), exchange material never becomes facts, quarantine reason asserted, end-to-end through the ContextPacket zod gate, pipeline halts on sealed content, no-case-content regression.
- `package.json`: suite appended to the `test` chain (CI gate).

### Invariants
Scoring-store firewall strengthened from ingest-only to ingest + live packet boundary; sealed content is now a hard stop on the live path. Raw-lab invariant untouched (parser path unchanged; the one adjacent open question is quarantined, not shipped). Spine, hashing, verifier checks untouched. Nothing patient-facing.

### Register impact
- `context-injection-allowlist` → **COMPLETE / resolved**; gap-register **R-26 → Resolved 2026-07-03 (M3)**; index + firewall-status paragraph re-synced.
- **NEW** `objective-data-offered-sanitiser-policy` (Medium, pf:true, input-gated) — the charter's open follow-up is now register-tracked with the decision options stated (pass as-is / band via parser / keep withheld).
- FMEA F9 mitigation in place (residual 2×5 → 1×5 per plan).

### Verification
`npm test` (18 suites) green; `npm run verification` pass; `npm run trunk:stub:all` 9/9; `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift; sealed-node reference grep = known engineering set only.

---

## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M2 — cross-trunk sequencer (DEAD_END-1 fix; HARD_FAIL propagates across trunks) (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `step-2-trunk-sequencer`. npm test 17/17 (new suite added), `npm run verification` pass, trunk stubs 9/9, `verify:rehash --integrity` 0 drift.

### Change
- `integration/trunk-sequencer.js` (new): the missing outer loop. Consumes the PARSED Trunk 1.0 `routing_plan.next_trunks` (zod-gated — a malformed plan throws and never part-runs; unknown trunk ids rejected) and walks each routed trunk through the full five-step pipeline via `runTrunkWithGrounding` (no step bypassed). **Halts unconditionally, no override path**, on: Trunk 1.0 `safety_gate` escalate_now/T5 (before any routed trunk — routing never outruns the safety gate); `continuation_blocked` from any trunk (a pharmacology HARD_FAIL or BLOCKED_NO_PROOF now blocks the WHOLE sequence — FMEA F2 closed); escalate_now/T5 signalled in any trunk output (conservative over-halt: over-triage-safe); and verification `pass=false` (a rejected output is never upstream context for the next trunk). Emits the ordered execution record of ARCH_PLAN §3.5.5 (`executed[]`, `halted_at?`, `halt_reason?`), zod-validated.
- Feature flag `HEYDOC_SEQUENCER` (**default OFF** = rollback): when off, `runTrunkSequence` runs nothing and returns a disabled record — the single-trunk status quo.
- `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: re-exports `runTrunkSequence`/`isSequencerEnabled` as the one integration surface; header documents that manual multi-trunk chaining must honour `continuation_blocked` until the flag is on.
- `test/contract-sequencer.js` (new, wired into `npm test` → CI): default-off runs nothing; `next_trunks` consumed in order; HARD_FAIL halts (later trunks never run, blocking entry recorded); BLOCKED_NO_PROOF halts; Trunk 1.0 escalate gate halts before anything runs; mid-sequence escalate_now and structured T5 short-circuit; verification failure halts; malformed plan throws; empty plan is a valid no-op; re-export identity.
- `package.json`: suite appended to the `test` chain (CI gate).

### Invariants
No-HARD_FAIL-override now holds **across the sequence**, not only within one trunk. Five-step spine untouched (the sequencer adds the outer loop only). Hashing, verifier checks, sanitiser untouched. Escalation detection over-halts on ambiguity (under-triage outranks over-triage). Nothing patient-facing; flag off by default.

### Register impact
- `routing-plan-next-trunks-dead-end` (DEAD_END-1) → **COMPLETE / resolved**; gap-register **R-24 → Resolved 2026-07-03 (M2)**; index re-synced. FMEA F2/F8/F10 mitigations in place (F2 residual 4×5→2×5 per plan).
- Residual (by design, documented): sequencer engages only with `HEYDOC_SEQUENCER` on; callers chaining trunks manually must honour `continuation_blocked` themselves.

### Verification
`npm test` (17 suites) green; `npm run verification` pass; `npm run trunk:stub:all` 9/9; `npm run verify:rehash -- --integrity` 0 drift.

---

## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M1 — mode-normaliser (C16/F4 mode-flag leakage closed) (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `step-1-mode-normaliser`. npm test 16/16 (new suite added), `npm run verification` pass, trunk stubs 9/9, `verify:rehash --integrity` 349/349 zero drift.

### Change
- `verification/mode.js` (new): the single mapping between the env vocabulary (`HEYDOC_MODE_DEFAULT`: mock/staging/production/dry_run) and the receipt/packet/ledger enforcement enum (mock/dry_run/live). `staging`/`production` → `live` (mock proof **blocked**); `mock`/`dry_run` stay dev (mock proof flagged, not blocked); **unrecognised mode → default-deny to `live`**; absence keeps the documented dev default (mock).
- `verification/verifier.js`: `enforceLive` now derives via `normaliseMode(evidence.context_mode).enforce_live` instead of `=== "live"` (the F4 hole). Monotone-stricter only; the five checks untouched; hash-first untouched.
- `verification/pipeline.js`: `context_mode` derived via the normaliser — always enum-valid for the ContextPacket/verifier/ledger contracts (a raw `staging` string previously crashed packet validation).
- `verification/audit-store.js` `recordRun`: **second F4 site found during M1 research and closed in the same step** — `synthetic = mode !== "live"` on the raw env meant a `staging` run would have persisted output content as synthetic AND handed the ledger an enum-invalid mode. Now normalised: staging/production runs are non-synthetic (content NOT persisted, `content_persisted=false`).
- `test/contract-mode-normaliser.js` (new, wired into `npm test` → CI): mapping table, case/trim tolerance, absence default, default-deny; verifier blocks mock proof in staging/production/live/unknown and flags-not-blocks in mock/dry_run; live receipt still grounds in staging; pipeline end-to-end (packet mode enum-valid, mock-grounded code blocked in staging, binds in mock); ledger classification (staging → mode "live", no content persisted; mock → synthetic persisted). Throwaway `HEYDOC_DATA_DIR`.
- `package.json`: new suite appended to the `test` chain (CI gate).

### Invariants
No check weakened; enforcement strictly strengthened (old: only `"live"` blocked; new: staging/production/unknown also block; mock/dry_run behaviour unchanged; absent context_mode unchanged). Hashing, HARD_FAIL handling, sanitiser, and the five-step spine untouched. Nothing patient-facing.

### Register impact
- `mode-leakage-enforcelive` → **COMPLETE / resolved** (completeness-register + index); gap-register **R-25 → Resolved 2026-07-03 (M1)**; `.claude/server-status.md` C16 caveat replaced with the resolved semantics.
- Residual tracked, not a defect: MCP servers stamp `receipt.mode` from their own env read and only ever run mock today — server-side stamping is normalised at live-connect (M9/M11, noted in R-25 + register evidence).

### Verification
`npm test` (16 suites) green; `npm run verification` pass; `npm run trunk:stub:all` 9/9; `npm run verify:rehash -- --integrity` 349 content checked, 0 drift.

---

## ARCH_PLAN Milestone M0 — reconciliation & re-scan (docs only) (2026-07-03)

**Status:** Complete. No code, no new tests. Baseline + post-change `npm test` both 15/15 green (identical).

**Operator override (recorded):** *Model routing amended by operator 2026-07-02 — Fable 5 for reasoning/hard-logic steps, Opus 4.8 for scaffolding; supersedes charter Opus-plan/Sonnet-execute split.* Applied to the `.planning/ARCH_PLAN.md` header.

### Blueprint
- `.planning/ARCH_PLAN.md` **created in-repo** (operator-approved copy of the Desktop blueprint), v1.0.0 → v1.0.1: (a) FMEA §3.6 Owner column renumbered to §3.7 milestones (F2/F8/F10→M2, F3→M8, F5/F6→M11, F7→M10, F9→M3, F11→M7, F12→M4, F13→M5, F14→M9, F15→M0; F1 annotated *unscheduled — verifier fuzz hardening, propose alongside M6*); (b) model-split header line per the operator override above.

### Register moves (completeness-register ↔ gap-register, one-way promotion)
- **C18/F15 closed** — `case-set-underpopulated`: row said 1 case; live count is **52 directories** in `data/cases/` (47 difficulty-01 / 5 difficulty-04 incl. reference; 51 clinician-attested, bulk attestation KL 2026-07-02). ≥45 minimum MET; distribution skew + terminology receipts remain (→ M6). Dangling `gap_register_link: gap-case-set` fixed → mirrored as **R-23** (Medium).
- **C17 closed** — gap-register §1b prose reconciled to built reality: `deterministic-investigation-parser` (built, `verification/investigation-parser.js`, provisional ranges), `pharmacological-firewall` (mock core + Trunk 8.0 wired, contract-tested, live vendor pending), `medicolegal-audit-ledger` (built, `verification/audit-store.js`, prod WORM pending). C15 `severity=warning` wording deliberately **untouched** (M7, operator-gated).
- **NEW `routing-plan-next-trunks-dead-end`** (DEAD_END-1, High, pf:true) → promoted **R-24**. Verified: zero JS references to `next_trunks`/`routing_plan`; fix = M2 sequencer; do not build on this edge.
- **NEW `mode-leakage-enforcelive`** (C16/F4, High, pf:true) → promoted **R-25**. Verified: `enforceLive = contextMode === "live"` (exact string); staging/production would accept mock receipts; fix = M1 mode-normaliser. Caveat added to `.claude/server-status.md`.
- **`context-injection-allowlist` recorded in-register** (was index/HANDOFF-only despite the register being the index's source of truth) → promoted **R-26** (High, pf:true); fix = M3.
- **NEW `case-dir-duplicate-files`** (Medium) — 236 untracked `* 2.json` Finder duplicates across 30 case dirs, incl. sealed-node name duplicates (inventoried by filename only, never opened); delete under a gated cleanup step.
- **NEW `repo-digest-sealed-node-carveout`** (Low) — digest deliberately embeds the reference case's sealed 10–13 for engineering; must never enter an AI-Doctor context path; M3 allow-list test to carry a digest-shaped default-deny fixture.
- Milestone links added: `pipeline-routing-retrieval-stub` → C10, input-gated at live-connect under M11 (stale `pending-promotion` tag corrected — Medium, below threshold); `content-store-production-gated` → gated on C8/M4 + consent.
- Promotion section updated: 2026-06-30 pending list marked done (R-16–R-19); M0 promotions listed.
- Firewall re-check (M0): four scripts/tests read `data/cases`; **none routes 10–13 content into any trunk/packet path — NOT breached.** Index firewall paragraph updated.

### Derived docs (same step, per <context_loading>)
- `.claude/completeness-index.md` re-synced (case count, three new High rows, Medium + Low rows, firewall paragraph).
- `.claude/server-status.md` — C16 mode-enforcement caveat section added.

### Sequencing impact
None found that alters M1–M5 order: DEAD_END-1 exposure is contained (no multi-trunk caller exists; HARD_FAIL is terminal within a single `runTrunkWithGrounding` run, contract-tested), so M1 (mode) before M2 (sequencer) remains safe.

---

## `cases:ingest` — bundle → data/cases with field-scoped firewall (2026-07-01)

**Status:** Complete (tool). Branch `feat/cases-ingest`. Plan-gated build (approved). New dependency `ajv` (approved).

### Change
Adds the deterministic ingestion tool that admits `*.casebundle.json` files into `data/cases/`.

- `scripts/ingest-case-bundles.mjs` + `npm run cases:ingest`: per bundle → ajv-validate all 7 nodes (schemas are draft 2020-12) → `case_id` consistency → **field-scoped firewall check** → honesty gate (bundle hashes null, codes unverified) → split into `data/cases/<CASE_ID>/` → compute real **SHA-256** per file (fill manifest nulls) + `source.sha256` (if the `.txt` is alongside) + `ingest.bundle_sha256` → carry the clinician attestation through. Refuses (exit 1, writes nothing) on any gate failure; `--dry-run`, `--out`, `--force`.
- `test/contract-case-ingest.js` (wired into `npm test`, now 15 suites): round-trips the reference case (8 files + real SHA-256), and asserts a diagnosis-name leak into `01` and a `case_id` mismatch are both refused.

### Firewall allow-list (the finding, now enforced in code)
The firewall is **finer than file-level**. Only sub-fields injected into the AI-Doctor/patient-simulator exchange are scanned: all of `01` **except** `psychosocial_profile` + `digital_tablet_field_map` (simulator-direction/mapping metadata), and in `02` only `disclosure_items[].{clinical_fact,patient_response_template,patient_deflection_template}`, `patient_initiated_exchanges[].patient_text`, `deflection_behaviours[].deflection_text_template`. `00` and `02` scoring fields are metadata and legitimately reference the diagnosis. Leak = the **full** `primary_diagnosis.name` (not generic SNOMED-display words) or a source `.txt` filename appearing in injectable text. Validated: 51/51 real bundles pass with 0 true leaks.

### Reference-case fix
`data/cases/SPEC-CARD-04-00001/11_symptom_links_node.json` had 3 × `unlocks_symptom_id: null` — a pre-existing non-conformance (predates the schema hardening; schema forbids null). Removed (omit = "unlocks nothing"). Gold standard is now schema-clean.

### Register impact
- **NEW `context-injection-allowlist`** (High): the sub-field firewall is enforced at ingest, but the *live* context-injection layer (unbuilt) must apply the same allow-list before injecting `00/01/02` into a trunk. Registered.
- `case-set-underpopulated`: intake path now built (tool). Actual population (ingest the 51) is the next step.
- Firewall status: JS now **writes** `data/cases` (ingest) — it does not route sealed `10–13` content into a trunk; re-affirmed.

### Verification
`npm test` 15/15; `npm run cases:ingest -- "<folder>" --dry-run` → 51/51 OK, 0 leaks.

---

## Case transformation — bundled "kit" (single-file package) (2026-07-01)

**Status:** Complete. New derived artifact + build script.

### Change
Adds a **single self-contained package** so a Claude Chat / Cowork session can run the SOAP→case-set transformation from **one attachment** instead of 16 (protocol + omnibus + 7 schemas + 7 reference-case files).

- `scripts/build-case-transformation-kit.mjs` (new): assembles the kit from the repo's source files (Node ESM, no new dependency). Records a sha256 per embedded source in `_kit.contents` for version traceability, and parses the protocol version from the `.md` header.
- `docs/case-authoring/breath-ezy-case-transformation-kit.json` (new, generated, ~497 KB): `{_kit, protocol_markdown, digital_tablet_omnibus, node_schemas (7), reference_case (7)}`. `_kit.runner_prompt` is the Cowork sequential-ledger prompt adapted to read from the embedded kit; `_kit.how_to_use` covers Chat and Cowork.
- `package.json`: `npm run kit:build` to regenerate.

### Staleness note
The kit is **derived** — repo files are the source of truth. Re-run `npm run kit:build` after any change to the protocol, schemas, omnibus, or reference case. (Currently pinned to protocol `v1.2.0`.)

### Verification
Kit parses; 16 embedded sources (protocol + omnibus + 7 schemas + 7 reference files); protocol markdown includes §7.9; `npm test` unaffected.

### Register impact
None (docs/tooling). Supports the `case-set-underpopulated` intake path.

---

## Case transformation protocol — hardening from first real-case validation (2026-07-01)

**Status:** Complete. Docs-only. Protocol bumped to `case-transform-protocol:v1.2.0`. Triggered by hand-validating the first Chat-produced bundle (`AUC-021` cardiac arrest), which was clinically excellent but had **103 schema-conformance errors** + one firewall leak.

### Root causes fixed
- **Protocol defects (led Chat into invalid output):** skeletons used `null` for unknown optionals (schemas forbid null → omit); invented `source_note_reference` in `00` (both an invalid field **and** a firewall leak — the source filename contains the diagnosis); abbreviated `symptom_narrative` key names; §7 gave prose, not exact contracts.
- **Chat drift the protocol should have prevented:** `differentials`→`differential`, `snomed_ref` string→object, non-enum values, prose where tier-enums/objects required, added fields (`channel`/`reporter`/`bystander_state`), arrays where single strings required.

### Changes to `docs/case-authoring/case-transformation-protocol.md`
- **New §7.0 Hard conformance rules:** `additionalProperties:false` (no invented fields); `null` forbidden → omit; objects/arrays never rendered as strings; enums verbatim; reference-case key names exact; self-validate before emitting.
- **New §9.1 Case-ID mapping:** assign canonical `SPEC-{SPECIALTY}-{DD}-{SEQ}` (DD = difficulty-tier ordinal 01–07); source ID → `case_manifest.source.original_case_id`; provisional SEQ flagged for maintainer. Decoded from the schema's own documented convention (`AUC-021` → `SPEC-CARD-01-00021`).
- Fixed §7.1 (removed `source_note_reference` + null review fields), §7.2 (exact `symptom_narrative` keys, object shapes), §7.3–§7.7 (exact object/enum/single-string shapes for every field Chat got wrong), §7.8 (`original_case_id`), §12/§13 (no-null flagging, conformance + case-id checklist items).
- **§1 now mandates attaching the 7 node schema files + reference case** to the Chat session — the schema is the authoritative contract.

### Verification
All fenced JSON skeletons parse; version bumped consistently (3 spots); `differentials`/`null` references are all corrective. Case-ID convention verified against the schema's `case_id` pattern + description and the reference case (`SPEC-CARD-04` ↔ difficulty ordinal 4).

### Register impact
None (docs). User decision recorded: **map to canonical SPEC IDs** (schemas unchanged) rather than relax the pattern.

## Case transformation protocol — Bundle Output Mode (2026-07-01)

**Status:** Complete. Docs-only. Protocol bumped to `case-transform-protocol:v1.1.0`.

### Change
Adds **Bundle Output Mode** (§7.9) to `docs/case-authoring/case-transformation-protocol.md`: each case is emitted as **one `<CASE_ID>.casebundle.json`** — a single JSON envelope whose top-level keys are the 8 files, plus a `_bundle` header (`format`, `split_map`, `firewall_assertion`) telling repo ingestion how to split it. Now the default output (separate-block output still valid).
- One `JSON.parse` + write-each-key split (no fragile banner-regex); every sub-object is canonical JSON ready to hash + zod-validate.
- Firewall preserved: the bundle is an authoring/transport artifact, split *before* the pipeline; the AI Doctor never sees a bundle. Recommend gitignoring `*.casebundle.json`.
- Hashes stay `null`, codes stay `unverified` — unchanged from §7.8.
- Cross-refs updated (§1, §10, §11, §13); the planned `cases:ingest` tool now splits the bundle first.

### Verification
Bundle example parses as valid JSON (9 top keys: `_bundle` + 8); no lingering "8 blocks" references; `npm test` unaffected (docs-only).

### Register impact
None (docs). Supports the `case-set-underpopulated` intake path.

## Presentation-layer patient-obtainable objective data (2026-07-01)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `feat/presentation-objective-data`. Plan-gated schema change (approved).

### Change
Amends the telehealth reprojection rule so **patient-obtainable objective data may enter the AI-Doctor-readable presentation layer** — bounded and provenance-tagged. Clinician-only findings stay sealed.

- `data/schemas/01_presentation_layer.schema.json` (new optional `objective_data_offered[]`): home/wearable device readings, self-reported measurements, video-visible findings. Each item `{type, value (string+units), source (enum: patient_home_device|patient_wearable|patient_reported|video_observable|caregiver_reported), verified (default false), device_validated?, timing?, fhir_path?, reliability_caveat?}`. Top-level `additionalProperties:false` preserved; item objects closed. Enum **excludes** any clinician-measured source.
- `docs/case-authoring/case-transformation-protocol.md`: §6 rewritten (patient-obtainable → `01` tagged; clinician-only → sealed `10`/`11`), §4 routing rows split, §7.2 contract + example, §13 checklist.
- `CLAUDE.md <data_handling>`: added the telehealth carve-out note.

### Invariant posture
No hard limit weakened. `verified` = established encounter input, not gold-standard; clinician exam/labs/ECG remain sealed + receipt-gated; values stored as patient-stated strings (no structured raw-number bypass of the sanitiser). **Open follow-up flagged in CLAUDE.md:** confirm sanitiser policy for patient-reported vitals if the live pipeline injects `objective_data_offered` into trunk context.

### Verification
JSON Schema valid; reference case `SPEC-CARD-04-00001/01` still conforms; positive `objective_data_offered` example validates; unknown item field, missing `source`, and `clinician_measured` source all correctly rejected. `npm test` unaffected (case schemas not yet zod-wired in code).

### Register impact
No new `UNBUILT`/`DEAD_END`/`BLIND_STUB`. Refines the `01` contract in support of `case-set-underpopulated`.

---

## Doc reconciliation: charter + derived docs vs register (2026-07-01)

**Status:** Docs only — no code, schema, or contract touched; all three CI suites remain green (13/13 tests, verification pass, 9/9 trunk stubs). Closes two `Low`/`STALE` Completeness Register items. Operator-approved the CLAUDE.md edit before execution.

### Why
The registers and most derived docs were rebuilt 2026-06-30 and already reflected reality (all 7 servers mock-built, `PARTIAL`), but three prose artifacts lagged: CLAUDE.md still described the four mock-built servers as "specified, not built," and `.claude/server-status.md` contradicted itself on whether the pharmacology firewall was wired behind Trunk 8.0 (it is — R-22, `contract-firewall.js` passes).

### Changes
- `CLAUDE.md`: `<project_context>` repo map (line 33) now lists all seven servers as mock-built/`PARTIAL`; the no-build-step note (line 30) corrected (plain `.js`, not `dist/`); `audit-ledger-entry` added to the schema list (line 32); `<gap_register_and_build_sequence>` status lines + build-order annotated to reflect mock-complete items and the real remaining work (live vendors/EHR, sign-off, Clinician Portal, persistence, terminology contract).
- `.claude/server-status.md`: pharmacology row corrected — "live vendor + firewall wiring pending / Not yet wired behind Trunk 8.0" → "mock core + Trunk 8.0 firewall wired; live vendor pending," with the receipt-backed HARD_FAIL + contract-test note.
- `.claude/schema-index.md`: verified against disk (12/12 `mcp/schemas` + 7/7 `data/schemas`) — accurate, no change needed.
- Register: `claudemd-behind-charter` and `derived-docs-unverified` → `status: resolved` (both `Low`); `.claude/completeness-index.md` synced.

### Register / gap-register impact
- Completeness Register: 2 `STALE` (Low) → `resolved`. No items opened. Gap-register: unchanged (neither item was ever promoted — both `Low`, `gap_register_link: none`).

## fhir-broker + messaging-geo (mock) + FHIR→parser path (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Mock complete. Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Advances `fhir-broker-unbuilt` + `messaging-geo-unbuilt` to PARTIAL — the last two servers now have mock implementations, so **all 7 MCP servers are built (mock)**.

### Changes
- `mcp/servers/fhir-broker/` (index.js + mock-resources.json): `fhir_read`/`fhir_search` return templated AU Core resources (incl. lab Observations with raw values); `fhir_write` SAFE_STUB. **FHIR→parser path:** on the MCP path, Trunk 6.0 Observations → `retrieveFhirObservations` → `raw_investigations` → the deterministic parser → sanitised `lab_result` facts (raw number never in the packet).
- `mcp/servers/messaging-geo/index.js`: `geo_locate`/`pharmacy_search` mock; `msg_send` SAFE_STUB that NEVER sends (recipient redacted/not echoed, flagged not-patient-facing). Not wired into the trunk pipeline (patient-facing, gated by the Clinician Verification Portal).
- `verification/{retrieval-mcp,pipeline}.js`: `retrieveFhirObservations`; `routing()` sets `needs_fhir_reads:["Observation"]` for Trunk 6.0; fhir labs merge into `raw_investigations`.
- `test/contract-fhir-broker.js` + `test/contract-messaging-geo.js` wired into `npm test` (13/13).
- `mcpServers.template.json` both paths `dist/index.js` → `index.js`; server-status / mcp-server-map / registers updated.

### Register movement
- `fhir-broker-unbuilt` → **PARTIAL** (mock read/search + Observation→parser; live EHR + AU Core/AUCDI conformance pending). `messaging-geo-unbuilt` → **PARTIAL** (mock; never-sends; live providers pending). `investigation-parser-unbuilt` now has a mock fhir lab source.

### Verification
- `npm test` 13/13; `trunk:stub:all` 9/9 stub + live MCP; Trunk 6.0 (MCP) → 2 sanitised HH lab facts from fhir, raw values absent from the packet.

---

## Knowledge server (mock) + curated datasets (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Mock complete. Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Mock-resolves `knowledge-datasets-empty` + gap-register **R-13**; advances `knowledge-server-unbuilt`; opens `knowledge-datasets-provisional` (High).

### Changes
- `mcp/servers/knowledge/data/{benign-registry,axis-b-templates,redflags-bank}.json` (new): versioned, checksummed, **DEV/SYNTHETIC-ONLY — not clinically authoritative** datasets for Trunks 7.0/5.0/9.0.
- `mcp/servers/knowledge/index.js` (new): McpServer; `kg_query`/`kg_provenance` real over the datasets; ContextGraph/PatientKnowledgeGraph return empty (no graph store — never fabricated); `kg_upsert`/`kg_export` SAFE_STUB (`unavailable`, no fake revision/artifact).
- `verification/pipeline.js`: `routing()` sets `needs_structured_kg` per trunk (7.0→benign-registry, 5.0→axis-b-templates, 9.0→redflags-bank); `retrievalStub` emits a mock `structured_dataset` receipt; `contextInjection` maps `structured_dataset` → EvidenceNode support (ref = dataset_version).
- `verification/retrieval-mcp.js`: `retrieveKnowledge()` (kg_query per dataset) on the MCP path.
- `test/contract-knowledge.js` (new) wired into `npm test` (11/11).
- `mcpServers.template.json` knowledge path `dist/index.js` → `index.js`; server-status / mcp-server-map / registers updated.

### Register movement
- `knowledge-datasets-empty` → **COMPLETE (dev)**; `knowledge-server-unbuilt` → **PARTIAL** (live PostgreSQL graph store pending); **opened** `knowledge-datasets-provisional` (High — clinical sign-off). R-13 mock-resolved. ContextGraph/PatientKnowledgeGraph now have a (mock, empty) producer.

### Verification
- `npm test` 11/11; `trunk:stub:all` 9/9 stub + live MCP; structured_dataset evidence reaches the packet (trunk 7.0 → benign-registry:v0.1.0-dev) and the packet validates.

---

## Trunk 8.0 pharmacology firewall — wired + HARD_FAIL enforced (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete (mock). Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Advances `pharmacology-server-unbuilt` / gap-register **R-22** — only the live vendor remains.

Turns the pharmacology mock core into an enforced firewall behind Trunk 8.0.

### Changes
- `mcp/servers/pharmacology/engine.js` (new): pure `runPharmCheck()` extracted from `index.js` (refactor — same logic), so the MCP server and the in-process firewall share one engine.
- `verification/pipeline.js`: when a Trunk 8.0 turn carries `pharm_intent`, runs the firewall in-process — `firewall_status` gates continuation; **HARD_FAIL → `continuation_blocked` with no override path** + `hard_stops` + receipt-backed `hard_stop_receipt`; the PharmCheck receipt flows into the packet + ledger. No-intent on Trunk 8.0 → BLOCKED_NO_PROOF + blocked. Grounding-pass kept separate (the honest BLOCKED_NO_PROOF stub stays green).
- `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: accepts `{ pharmIntent, resolvedFacts }`; surfaces `firewall_status`/`continuation_blocked` and report `hard_stops`/`overall_severity`.
- `test/contract-firewall.js` (new) wired into `npm test` (10/10): HARD_FAIL blocks (no override) + receipt-backed check 5; an invented HARD_FAIL (no receipt) fails check 5; PASS doesn't block; no-intent → BLOCKED_NO_PROOF + blocked + grounding-passes.
- `architecture/trust-boundaries.md`, server-status, registers updated.

### Register movement
- `pharmacology-server-unbuilt`: remaining gap narrowed to **live vendor only** (firewall + HARD_FAIL enforcement done). Enforces no-autonomous-prescription + no-HARD_FAIL-override hard limits.

### Verification
- `npm test` 10/10; `trunk:stub:all` 9/9 (stub unaffected); HARD_FAIL blocks with no override, invented hard-stop rejected by check 5.

## Pharmacology server — deterministic mock core (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Mock core complete (not wired). Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Advances `pharmacology-server-unbuilt` (#1 gap) / gap-register **R-22**.

The highest-leverage Critical: the only permitted source of dose guidance and the Trunk 8.0 firewall.

### Changes
- `mcp/servers/pharmacology/mock-data.json` (new): versioned, **MOCK/SYNTHETIC-ONLY — not a clinical source**; allergy cross-reactivity groups, DDI pairs, renal rules, AU schedule map, mock dose guidance.
- `mcp/servers/pharmacology/schemas.js` (new): zod PharmIntent (lenient input) + PharmCheck (strict output) + validators.
- `mcp/servers/pharmacology/index.js` (new): McpServer (SDK ^1, stdio) with `pharm_check` + `pharm_intent`. Deterministic engine — allergy x-react, DDI, renal dosing, AU scheduling, S8 PDMP. Invariants: dose_guidance ONLY on PASS/WARN and NEVER on HARD_FAIL/BLOCKED/paediatric; HARD_FAIL terminal; paediatric (<18) → flag, no dose; absent facts → NOT_RUN → BLOCKED_NO_PROOF; every result mode=mock, MOCK vendor_reference.
- `test/contract-pharmacology.js` (new), wired into `npm test` (9/9): PASS+dose, BLOCKED_NO_PROOF, allergy HARD_FAIL no-dose, S8 HARD_FAIL, paediatric HARD_FAIL no-dose, receipt mode=mock.
- `mcpServers.template.json`: pharmacology path `dist/index.js` → `index.js` (no build step). `.claude/server-status.md` updated.

### Register movement
- `pharmacology-server-unbuilt`: Critical, UNBUILT → **PARTIAL / in-progress** (mock core; firewall wiring = next task, live vendor = standing gap).

### Next / not done
- Wire intent→PharmCheck→firewall_status behind Trunk 8.0 + verifier HARD_FAIL-blocks-continuation (next task). Live vendor (MIMS-AU/SafeScript) in staging before patient-facing. Mock data is not a clinical source.

### Verification
- `npm test` 9/9; engine smoke across all scenarios correct; dose never present on HARD_FAIL/BLOCKED/paediatric.

---

## Deterministic investigation parser (sanitiser) — built for mock/dev (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete (mock/dev). Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Resolves `investigation-parser-unbuilt` engine / gap-register **R-21** (named release blocker); opens `lab-reference-ranges-provisional` (High).

Enforces the hard limit "no raw lab numbers to LLM context": a raw numeric result is converted to an HL7 interpretation + qualitative string before it can enter a packet — the raw number never reaches the trunk.

### Changes
- `verification/data/lab-reference-ranges.json` (new): 8 LOINC-keyed analytes, dataset_version, **DEV/SYNTHETIC-ONLY — not clinically authoritative** banner, adult sex-agnostic bands.
- `verification/investigation-parser.js` (new): `sanitiseInvestigation()` → conformant `lab_result` fact (HL7 N/H/L/HH/LL + qualitative value, no raw number, `sanitised_by`) + dataset_version/checksum receipt; unknown/non-numeric fail safe to `U`.
- `verification/pipeline-schemas.js`: ContextPacket refinement — `lab_result` facts must carry `sanitised_by` and a non-numeric value.
- `verification/pipeline.js`: `contextInjection` runs `options.raw_investigations` through the parser into sanitised facts (parser now has a real consumer).
- `test/contract-investigation-parser.js` (new) + pipeline integration test (raw 6.8 → `HH` fact; raw number absent from the whole packet). `npm test` 8/8.
- `architecture/trust-boundaries.md`: documented the no-raw-lab enforcement.

### Register movement
- `investigation-parser-unbuilt`: Critical, UNBUILT → **PARTIAL / in-progress** (engine built mock/dev; named-blocker engine criterion met).
- **Opened** `lab-reference-ranges-provisional` (High): dev ranges need clinical + regulatory sign-off before patient-facing; live lab source (fhir-broker) also pending.

### Verification
- `npm test` 8/8; `verification` + `trunk:stub:all` 9/9 stub + live MCP; integration confirms the raw value never reaches the packet.

## Register correction — ContextGraph / PatientKnowledgeGraph are not dead-ends (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Reclassification (no code). Register/doc-only.

Phase 0 over-flagged `context-graph` and `patient-knowledge-graph` as DEAD_END. Investigation shows both are contracted across the spec — `grounding-plan` (`needs_structured_kg`, `live_call_specs` graph_kind), `evidence-node` (`kg_node` supports), the knowledge server's `kg.query` (mcp/README, mcp-server-map), architecture and data-buckets docs. They have no JS producer only because the **knowledge server is UNBUILT** — the same awaiting-producer status as `pharm-intent`/`pharm-check` vs the pharmacology server. Removing them would break those references; the correct resolution is to keep and track them under `knowledge-server-unbuilt`.

- Completeness Register: both reclassified DEAD_END → COMPLETE (contracted schema awaiting registered producer), `gap_register_link` → knowledge datasets; dropped from the dead-end build-checklist line.
- `.claude/completeness-index.md`: removed (no longer open findings).

No schema files changed.

---

## Pipeline edges contracted — GroundingPlan + ContextPacket gated (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Resolves `pipeline-edges-uncontracted` (Medium).

The routing→retrieval and context-injection step boundaries passed data with no schema gate. Added zod validators mirroring the JSON contracts and enforced them; reworked the stub so the packet actually conforms.

### Changes
- `verification/pipeline-schemas.js` (new): zod `GroundingPlanSchema`, `ContextPacketSchema`, `EvidenceNodeSchema`, `ReceiptSchema` + `validateGroundingPlan()`/`validateContextPacket()` (throw).
- `verification/pipeline.js`: validate the GroundingPlan after routing and the ContextPacket after injection. Reworked `contextInjection()` to emit a conformant packet — `receipts[]` holds only clean Receipts (request_id/timestamp_utc/upstream/mode; `validated_codes`/`kind` dropped), and `static_doc` citations move into `evidence[].supports[]`.
- `test/contract-pipeline.js` (new), wired into `npm test` (now 7/7): validators accept conformant data; reject missing-required, extra-key, receipt-missing-timestamp, receipt-with-validated_codes, and malformed EvidenceNodes.
- `.claude/schema-index.md`: noted the zod gate on grounding-plan / context-packet.

### Notes
- The VerificationReport edge was already gated (report-schema.js); with this, all four named pipeline contracts are enforced. EvidenceNode and Receipt are validated as part of the ContextPacket.
- `recordRun()`/ledger and the evidence_tree builder remain compatible with the conformant packet; citations are now represented in evidence rather than as pseudo-receipts in the ledger.

### Verification
- `npm test` 7/7; `npm run verification` + `trunk:stub:all` green on stub and live (HEYDOC_USE_MCP=1); produced GroundingPlan + ContextPacket validate; ledger chain VALID.

---

## Verifier hardening — code detection + binding + mock-mode (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Resolves `verifier-weak-code-detection` / gap-register **R-19**; opens `terminology-contract-incomplete` / **R-20** (High).

The `no_invented_codes` check was weak: it matched ICD-11 only (not the pinned ICD-10-AM), let any terminology receipt clear all codes, and never flagged mock receipts.

### Changes
- `verification/verifier.js`: detection across SNOMED CT / ICD-10-AM / ICD-11 / LOINC / PBS with false-positive guards (dotted/dash-check/labelled forms always flagged; bare ICD/PBS context-gated so "vitamin B12", vitals, and YYYY-MM dates don't trip). **True per-code↔receipt binding** for SNOMED/ICD-10-AM/LOINC (each token must be in a receipt's validated_codes; ICD-11/PBS coarse, documented). **Mock-mode flagging**: mock receipts listed in `mock_receipt_flags`; in a non-mock `context_mode` they no longer ground (block).
- `verification/pipeline.js`: threads validated codes + per-receipt modes + context_mode into evidence; mock terminology receipt declares its validated code.
- `verification/retrieval-mcp.js`: captures `validated_codes` from the live lookup; **fixes a pre-existing bug** where the terminology receipt's outer `upstream` was the vendor name, so the pipeline never recognised it (binding silently failed on the MCP path).
- `mcp/schemas/verification-report.schema.json` + `report-schema.js` + both writers: optional `mock_receipt_flags`.
- `test/contract-verifier.js`: per-system detection, FP guards, binding (match/mismatch), mock flag + non-mock block.

### Register movement
- `verifier-weak-code-detection`: High, PARTIAL → **COMPLETE/resolved** (R-19).
- **Opened** `terminology-contract-incomplete` (High, R-20): terminology grounds only SNOMED + ICD-11; ICD-10-AM/LOINC/PBS ungroundable → hardened verifier blocks them (fail-safe). Feeds the AUCDI R3 value-set binding item.

### Verification
- `npm test` 6/6; `trunk:stub:all` 9/9 on both stub and live (HEYDOC_USE_MCP=1) paths.

---

## AU Core structural conformance validator (vendored SDs) (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Structural validator complete (mock). Branch `feat/aucore-conformance` (stacked on `feat/terminology-r20`). Advances `fhir-r4-aucdi-conformance-unbuilt`.

### Changes
- `mcp/servers/fhir-broker/au-core/` (new): VENDORED AU Core StructureDefinition snapshot — 5 SDs (Patient/Condition/MedicationRequest/AllergyIntolerance/DiagnosticResult) at **2.0.1-ci-build** (FHIR 4.0.1), with a checksummed `manifest.json` (source URL + fetch date). CI build (not a stable release).
- `mcp/servers/fhir-broker/conformance.js` (new) + `fhir_validate` tool: deterministic structural validation over the snapshot — profile/type match, required (min≥1), cardinality, fixed code-system; **ValueSet membership + FHIRPath invariants reported `not_evaluated`** (need live NCTS). No new runtime dependency; offline.
- `test/contract-fhir-conformance.js` (new) wired into `npm test` (14/14).
- `CLAUDE.md <standards_pins>`, server-status, registers updated.

### Version-target flag (regulatory)
Per operator decision, the validator runs against the **current CI build (2.0.1-ci)** — this **diverges from the pinned AU Core 0.3.0**. The authoritative AU Core version is an unsettled org/regulatory conformance-target decision.

### Register movement
- `fhir-r4-aucdi-conformance-unbuilt`: Medium, UNBUILT → **PARTIAL** (structural done; ValueSet-binding + full invariant validation need live NCTS). **Resolved** `au-core-sd-snapshot` (vendored).

### Verification
- `npm test` 14/14; `trunk:stub:all` 9/9; conformant→conformant, missing-required→non_conformant, binding→not_evaluated.

## Terminology multi-system grounding + Digital Tablet import (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Mock complete. Branch `feat/terminology-r20`. Advances `terminology-contract-incomplete` / gap-register **R-20**; imports the Digital Tablet.

The terminology layer grounded only SNOMED + ICD-11, so the invariant's ICD-10-AM/LOINC/PBS codes were un-groundable and blocked by the hardened verifier.

### Changes
- `data/digital_tablet_omnibus.json` (new): the "Digital Tablet" AU Core R4 schema capsule (was referenced by the schemas but absent). Declares SNOMED CT-AU / ICD-10-AM 12th / LOINC 2.77 / PBS / AMT and the terminology_servers (NCTS Ontoserver). No secrets.
- `mcp/schemas/terminology-lookup.schema.json`: `system` enum → SNOMED_CT/ICD_10_AM/ICD_11/LOINC/PBS/AMT.
- `mcp/servers/terminology/index.js` + `terminology-servers.json` (new): all 3 tools accept the extended enum; per-system mock concepts (echo a looked-up code so any code validates); live NCTS/Ontoserver endpoints recorded from the Digital Tablet, **used only in live mode — mock never calls them**.
- `verification/verifier.js`: per-code binding extended to PBS (context-gated) and AMT (SNOMED-form); ICD-11 stays coarse.
- `verification/retrieval-mcp.js`: `retrieveTerminology` grounds multiple systems (SNOMED + ICD-10-AM + LOINC).
- Tests: `contract-terminology.js` validates each system; `contract-verifier.js` adds PBS bind/unbind. `npm test` 13/13.

### Register movement
- `terminology-contract-incomplete` (R-20): High, PARTIAL → **advanced** (mock multi-system + per-code binding; live NCTS + AU Core value-set binding remain input-gated).
- **Imported/resolved** `digital-tablet-omnibus` (resolves a dangling schema reference).

### Verification
- `npm test` 13/13; `trunk:stub:all` 9/9 stub + live MCP; end-to-end ICD-10-AM `M54.5` binds on the MCP terminology path.

---

## Standards registration — FHIR R4 / AUCDI R3 grounding scoped (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Registered (not built). Operator request to ground HL7 FHIR R4 + AUCDI Release 3.

Placed in topology: FHIR R4 and AUCDI R3 are structure/data-model standards (trust boundary 3), not terminology code systems — distinct from the SNOMED/ICD/LOINC/PBS terminology layer. AUCDI R3 supplies required terminology bindings that can later enrich the verifier's code↔receipt binding.

- `<standards_pins>` (CLAUDE.md): **AUCDI Release 3** added, supplementing AU Core 0.3.0. Whether AUCDI R3 re-targets or only supplements the AU Core conformance target is flagged as an unsettled org/regulatory decision.
- gap-register §3: AUCDI R3 row added.
- Completeness Register: opened `fhir-r4-aucdi-conformance-unbuilt` (Medium — deterministic FHIR R4 + AU Core + AUCDI R3 conformance validator in fhir-broker) and `aucdi-r3-valueset-binding-unbuilt` (Medium — AUCDI required-binding tables + verifier value-set enforcement).
- Sequencing: registered now; to be scoped (Phase 1) after `verifier-weak-code-detection` (item 2), which it depends on.

## Verifier test coverage — 5 hard checks under test (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`. Resolves `verifier-untested` / gap-register **R-18**.

`<test_and_evaluation_gates>` forbids untested deterministic safety code; the five verifier checks had no tests. Added `test/contract-verifier.js` covering, per check, a clean PASS, a violation FAIL, and the receipt/citation that flips FAIL→PASS — for `no_invented_codes`, `no_invented_guidelines`, `no_invented_operations`, `no_repo_invention`, `hard_stop_enforcement` — plus the `candidate_output_hash` return, overall-pass logic, and a `runPipeline()` integration (5 results). Wired into `npm test` (now 6/6). No verifier behaviour change; the tests assert the current contract and will be extended alongside `verifier-weak-code-detection`.

---

## Append-only audit ledger + synthetic content store + rehash (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete (mock/staging scope). Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`.

Mock-resolves Completeness Register `receipt-store-append-only-unbuilt` / gap-register **R-17**, and opens `content-store-production-gated` (Medium). Builds the durable, tamper-evident audit trail required by `<observability_and_audit>` while respecting `<data_handling>` patient-data minimisation via a two-store split.

### Design
- **Append-only hash-chained ledger** (`medicolegal-audit-ledger`) — non-PHI: hash anchor + run/trunk metadata + pass gate + per-check booleans + receipt metadata. Each entry's `entry_hash` chains over its canonical content + the previous entry's hash, so any edit/insert/reorder breaks the chain.
- **Synthetic-only content store** — exact output text, content-addressed by hash; `persistContent()` mechanically refuses non-synthetic data; live entries are forced `content_persisted=false`. Real-patient persistence is deferred to the session-persistence Critical + consent.

### Changes
- `mcp/schemas/audit-ledger-entry.schema.json` + `verification/ledger-schema.js` (new): ledger record contract + zod `validateLedgerEntry()` (throws; rejects PHI keys and live+persisted).
- `verification/audit-store.js` (new): `appendEntry` (hash-chain), `verifyChain`, `persistContent` (synthetic guard), `readContent`, `recordRun`; `HEYDOC_DATA_DIR` override.
- `verification/run.js` + `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: call `recordRun()` after `validateReport()`.
- `verification/rehash.js` (new) + `verify:rehash` script: `--integrity` (recompute vs ledger + verify chain), `--reissue` (re-verify stored outputs → fresh hashed reports + ledger entries), `<path>` ingest.
- `test/contract-audit-store.js` (new), wired into `npm test`.
- `.heydoc-data/` stays gitignored — the store is runtime data, never committed.
- Docs: `architecture/trust-boundaries.md` (Boundary 5 + the patient-data split), `.claude/schema-index.md`.

### Register movement
- `receipt-store-append-only-unbuilt`: High, UNBUILT → **PARTIAL / in-progress** (mock-resolved; prod WORM + retention pending) — R-17.
- **Opened** `content-store-production-gated`: Medium, PARTIAL (synthetic-only until session-persistence Critical + consent).
- `session-persistence-unenforced` (Critical): unchanged — explicitly not claimed.

### Verification
- `npm test` → 5/5 (adds `contract-audit-store: OK`).
- `verify:rehash --integrity` → chain VALID, hashes match; `--reissue` → outputs re-verified, hashes reproduce; planted content drift → exit 1.

## Medicolegal hashing — candidate_output_hash implemented (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete. Branch `chore/import-and-remediate`.

Closes Completeness Register `hashing-unimplemented` (Critical) and gap-register **R-16**. Before this change, the SHA-256 medicolegal anchor mandated by the prime directive was computed nowhere; the VerificationReport schema defined the field but left it optional, and neither report writer populated it.

### Changes
- `verification/hash.js` (new): `hashCandidateOutput()` — SHA-256 (`node:crypto`) over the exact, unmodified UTF-8 bytes of the candidate output; throws on non-string. No normalisation — the hash reflects exactly what was generated.
- `verification/verifier.js`: `verify()` computes `candidate_output_hash` first (before any output processing) and returns it.
- `verification/report-schema.js` (new): zod `VerificationReportSchema` mirroring the JSON schema; `validateReport()` throws on a malformed audit record.
- `verification/run.js`, `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: both writers include `candidate_output_hash` and call `validateReport()` before persisting.
- `mcp/schemas/verification-report.schema.json`: `candidate_output_hash` added to `required` (now 6); description + `_integration_notes` updated.
- `test/contract-verification-report.js` (new), wired into `npm test`: known SHA-256 vector, determinism, end-to-end hash==output, gate rejects missing/malformed/unknown-key.

### Register movement
- `hashing-unimplemented`: Critical, PARTIAL → **COMPLETE / resolved** (gap_register_link R-16).
- `pipeline-edges-uncontracted`: Medium → **partially addressed** (VerificationReport edge now zod-gated; GroundingPlan/ContextPacket/EvidenceNode edges remain open).

### Verification
- `npm test` → 4/4 (`contract-docs/identity-au/terminology/verification-report`: OK).
- `npm run verification` and `npm run trunk:stub:all` → reports carry a valid `sha256:…` hash and pass `validateReport()`; `Pass: true`, trunks 9/9.

## Maintenance — Supply-chain advisory remediation (2026-06-30)

**Status:** Complete (mock environment). Branch `chore/bump-mcp-sdk-1.29`.

Cleared all 3 High + 4 moderate `npm audit` advisories, all transitive via
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. None lay on an exercised code path — every server
and the verifier client use stdio transport, not the vulnerable HTTP/SSE stack —
but `<security_and_secrets>` makes High/Critical advisories build-blocking, so
they were cleared regardless.

### Changes
- `package.json`: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` floor `^1.0.0` → `^1.29.0`.
- `package-lock.json`: re-locked. Patched transitive deps now pinned:
  `hono 4.12.27`, `fast-uri 3.1.3`, `path-to-regexp 8.4.2`, `ip-address 10.2.0`,
  `qs 6.15.3`, `express-rate-limit 8.5.2`. No `overrides` needed; no major bumps;
  `zod` unchanged at 3.x. Stays within MCP SDK `^1` — no stack swap.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: added a blocking `npm audit --audit-level=high`
  step after `npm ci`.
- `gap-register.md`: added risk **R-14** (dependency advisory reaching build —
  Controlled) and **R-15** (no SAST/secret-scanning in CI — Open gap, still to be
  added before any patient-facing release).

### Verification
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` → 0 High/Critical.
- Clean `npm ci` from the new lockfile → `found 0 vulnerabilities` (reproducible).
- `npm test`, `npm run verification`, `npm run trunk:stub:all` all green.

### Execution phases

- **E** ✅ Design artifacts in repo (this checkpoint).
- **Step 2** ✅ First MCP servers implemented (2025-03-19):
  - `mcp/servers/docs/index.js`: `docs_search`, `docs_get`, `docs_cite` (mock/dry_run).
  - `mcp/servers/identity-au/index.js`: `identity_verify`, `identity_lookup_ihi`, `identity_log_consent` (stub/mock/dry_run).
  - Contract tests: `test/contract-docs.js`, `test/contract-identity-au.js`. Run with `npm test` (requires `npm install`).
- **Step 3** ✅ Verification harness (2025-03-19):
  - `verification/pipeline.js`: 5-step runner (stub routing/retrieval/generation).
  - `verification/verifier.js`: checks for invented codes, guidelines, operations, repo names, hard-stop.
  - `verification/run.js`: CLI; writes `verification/report.json` and `verification/evidence_tree.md`. Run: `npm run verification` or `node verification/run.js [candidate_output.txt]`.
- **Step 4** ✅ Wire Trunk agents to pipeline and verification layer (2025-03-19):
  - `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: `runTrunkWithGrounding(trunkId, userInput, options)` — runs pipeline + verification, optional write of report.json and evidence_tree.md.
  - `integration/README.md`: how Trunk agents call the integration.
  - `trunk/stub-agent.js`: first Trunk stub; one turn through pipeline and verification. Run: `npm run trunk:stub`.
- **Live MCP retrieval** (pipeline wired to real servers):
  - `verification/retrieval-mcp.js`: spawns docs and identity-au MCP servers via StdioClientTransport, calls `docs_search` and `identity_lookup_ihi`, collects receipts.
  - Pipeline uses live retrieval when `HEYDOC_USE_MCP=1` (or `options.use_mcp`); falls back to stub on failure or when unset.
  - `runPipeline` is async; `verification/run.js`, `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`, and `trunk/stub-agent.js` updated to await it.
- **Terminology MCP server** (code lock-in / no invented codes):
  - `mcp/servers/terminology/index.js`: tools `terminology_lookup`, `terminology_validate`, `terminology_map` (mock/dry_run); returns TerminologyLookup-shaped response with receipt.
  - `test/contract-terminology.js`: contract test; `npm test` now runs docs + identity-au + terminology.
  - `verification/retrieval-mcp.js`: when HEYDOC_USE_MCP=1, calls terminology server for plans that need terminology and collects receipt so verifier can satisfy "no invented codes" when output references SNOMED/ICD.
- **Trunk 2.0 system prompt**:
  - `trunk/prompts/trunk-2.0-system.md`: system prompt for Trunk 2.0 (triage only; no diagnosis, no dosages; grounding rules and citation discipline).
  - `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: `getTrunkSystemPrompt(trunkId)` loads `trunk/prompts/trunk-{id}-system.md` for use as LLM system message.
  - `integration/README.md`: documents system prompt loading and pipeline usage.
- **CI (GitHub Actions)**:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on push/PR to master or main, runs `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run verification`, `npm run trunk:stub:all` (Trunk 2.0 + 3.0 stubs).
- **Trunk 3.0 system prompt and stub**:
  - `trunk/prompts/trunk-3.0-system.md`: system prompt for Trunk 3.0 (structured history enrichment; no diagnosis, no dosages; output contract: follow_up_questions, structured_history, evidence_refs).
  - `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: `TRUNK_CONSTRAINTS["3.0"]` = ["no diagnosis", "no dosages", "history enrichment only"].
  - `trunk/trunk-3.0-stub-agent.js`: stub agent for Trunk 3.0; `npm run trunk:stub:3`. `npm run trunk:stub:all` runs both 2.0 and 3.0 stubs.
- **Trunk 7.0 system prompt and stub**:
  - `trunk/prompts/trunk-7.0-system.md`: code lock-in prompt (no diagnosis, no dosages, terminology receipt required for coded output).
  - `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: `TRUNK_CONSTRAINTS["7.0"]` includes no diagnosis/no dosages and terminology-receipt lock-in constraints.
  - `trunk/trunk-7.0-stub-agent.js`: stub agent for Trunk 7.0; `npm run trunk:stub:7`.
  - `package.json` aggregate run updated: `trunk:stub:all` now runs 2.0 through 7.0 stubs.
- **Trunk 8.0 system prompt and stub**:
  - `trunk/prompts/trunk-8.0-system.md`: pharmacology firewall intent-check prompt (no diagnosis, no dosages, blocked/HARD_FAIL handling explicit).
  - `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: `TRUNK_CONSTRAINTS["8.0"]` includes no diagnosis/no dosages and pharmacology firewall blocking constraints.
  - `trunk/trunk-8.0-stub-agent.js`: stub agent for Trunk 8.0; `npm run trunk:stub:8`.
  - `package.json` aggregate run updated: `trunk:stub:all` now runs 2.0 through 8.0 stubs.
- **Trunk 9.0 system prompt and stub**:
  - `trunk/prompts/trunk-9.0-system.md`: red-flag questionnaire and escalation-gate prompt (no diagnosis, no dosages, unknown/blocked states explicit).
  - `integration/trunk-pipeline.js`: `TRUNK_CONSTRAINTS["9.0"]` includes no diagnosis/no dosages plus red-flag questionnaire gating.
  - `trunk/trunk-9.0-stub-agent.js`: stub agent for Trunk 9.0; `npm run trunk:stub:9`.
  - `package.json` aggregate run updated: `trunk:stub:all` now runs 2.0 through 9.0 stubs.
- **Trunk 1.0 (originating/master) system prompt and stub**:
  - `trunk/prompts/trunk-1.0-system.md`: master/originating intake-routing and safety-gate prompt (no diagnosis, no dosages, evidence-bound escalation logic).
  - `trunk/trunk-1.0-stub-agent.js`: stub agent for Trunk 1.0; `npm run trunk:stub:1`.
  - `package.json` scripts updated: `trunk:stub` now aliases Trunk 1.0; added explicit `trunk:stub:2` for Trunk 2.0; `trunk:stub:all` now runs 1.0 through 9.0 stubs.
  - `integration/README.md` and `trunk/prompts/README.md` updated to include Trunk 1.0 as the originating step.
